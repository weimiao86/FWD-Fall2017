                <p class="description" id="overview_text"> Water covers 70% of our planet, and it is easy to think that it will always be plentiful.
                    However, freshwater—the stuff we drink, bathe in, irrigate our farm fields with—is
                    incredibly rare. Only 3% of the world’s water is fresh water, and two-thirds of that
                    is tucked away in frozen glaciers or otherwise unavailable for our use.<br> As a
                    result, some 1.1 billion people worldwide lack access to water, and a total of 2.7
                    billion find water scarce for at least one month of the year. Inadequate sanitation
                    is also a problem for 2.4 billion people—they are exposed to diseases, such as cholera
                    and typhoid fever, and other water-borne illnesses. Two million people, mostly children,
                    die each year from diarrheal diseases alone.<br>Many of the water systems that keep
                    ecosystems thriving and feed a growing human population have become stressed. Rivers,
                    lakes and aquifers are drying up or becoming too polluted to use. More than half
                    the world’s wetlands have disappeared. Agriculture consumes more water than any other
                    source and wastes much of that through inefficiencies. Climate change is altering
                    patterns of weather and water around the world, causing shortages and droughts in
                    some areas and floods in others.<br> At the current consumption rate, this situation
                    will only get worse. By 2025, two-thirds of the world’s population may face water
                    shortages. And ecosystems around the world will suffer even more.</p>

                        <p class="description">Water pollution comes from many sources including pesticides and fertilizers
                            that wash away from farms, untreated human wastewater, and industrial waste.
                            Even groundwater is not safe from pollution, as many pollutants can leach
                            into underground aquifers. Some effects are immediate, as when harmful bacteria
                            from human waste contaminate water and make it unfit to drink or swim in.
                            In other instances—such as toxic substances from industrial processes—it
                            may take years to build up in the environment and food chain before their
                            effects are fully recognized.</p>

                        <p class="description">Agriculture uses 70% of the world’s accessible freshwater, but some 60% of this
                            is wasted due to leaky irrigation systems, inefficient application methods
                            as well as the cultivation of crops that are too thirsty for the environment
                            in which they are grown. This wasteful use of water is drying out rivers,
                            lakes and underground aquifers. Many countries that produce large amounts
                            of food—including India, China, Australia, Spain and the United States—have
                            reached or are close to reaching their water resource limits. Added to these
                            thirsty crops are the fact that agriculture also generates considerable freshwater
                            pollution – both through fertilizers as well as pesticides – all of which
                            affect both humans and other species.</p>

                        <p class="description">In the last 50 years, the human population has more than doubled. This rapid
                            growth— with its accompanying economic development and industrialization—has
                            transformed water ecosystems around the world and resulted in a massive loss
                            of biodiversity. Today, 41% of the world’s population lives in river basins
                            that are under water stress. Concern about water availability grows as freshwater
                            use continues at unsustainable levels. Furthermore, these new faces also
                            need food, shelter, and clothing, thus resulting in additional pressure on

                        no local business or industry. Fire-fighting, municipal parks, and public swimming
                        pools all need lots of water. An array of pipes, canals, and pumping stations
                        managed by our public water systems are needed to bring a reliable supply of
                        water to our taps each day. People use large amounts of water: drinking, cooking
                        and washing, but even more for producing things such as food, paper, cotton clothes,
                        and almost every other physical product, this kind of wate is known as "Virtual

                                <p>#1 There are a number of ways to save water, and they all start with
                                    you. <br>#2When washing dishes by hand, don’t let the water run.
                                    Fill one basin with wash water and the other with rinse water.<br>#3
                                    Dishwashers typically use less water than washing dishes by hand.
                                    Now, Energy Star dishwashers save even more water and energy.<br>#4
                                    If your dishwasher is new, cut back on rinsing. Newer models clean
                                    more thoroughly than older ones.<br>#5 Designate one glass for your
                                    drinking water each day, or refill a water bottle. This will cut
                                    down on the number of glasses to wash.<br> #6 Soak pots and pans
                                    instead of letting the water run while you scrape them clean.
                                    <br> #7 Use the garbage disposal sparingly. Instead, compost vegetable
                                    food waste and save gallons every time.<br> #8 Wash your fruits and
                                    vegetables in a pan of water instead of running water from the tap.<br>#9
                                    Don’t use running water to thaw food. For water efficiency and food
                                    safety, defrost food in the refrigerator.<br> #10 Install an instant
                                    water heater near your kitchen sink so you don’t have to run the
                                    water while it heats up. This also reduces energy costs.<br>#11 Keep
                                    a pitcher of drinking water in the refrigerator instead of running
                                    the tap. This way, every drop goes down you and not the drain.
                                    <br> #12 Reuse leftover water from cooked or steamed foods to start
                                    a nutritious soup, it’s one more way to get eight glasses of water
                                    a day.<br>#13 Cook food in as little water as possible. This also
                                    helps it retain more nutrients.<br> #14 Select the proper pan size
                                    for cooking. Large pans may require more cooking water than necessary.
                                    <br> #15 If you accidentally drop ice cubes, don’t throw them in
                                    the sink. Drop them in a house plant instead.<br>#16 Collect the
                                    water you use while rinsing fruit and vegetables. Use it to water
                                    house plants.<br> #17 When shopping for a new dishwasher, use the
                                    Consortium for Energy Efficiency website to compare water use between
                                    models.

                                <p>#1 If your shower fills a one-gallon bucket in less than 20 seconds,
                                    replace the showerhead with a WaterSense® labeled model.<br> #2 Shorten
                                    your shower by a minute or two and you’ll save up to 150 gallons
                                    per month.<br> #3 Time your shower to keep it under 5 minutes. You’ll
                                    save up to 1,000 gallons per month.
                                    <br> #4 Toilet leaks can be silent! Be sure to test your toilet for
                                    leaks at least once a year.<br> #5 Put food coloring in your toilet
                                    tank. If it seeps into the bowl without flushing, there’s a leak.
                                    Fix it and start saving gallons.
                                    <br> #6 When running a bath, plug the bathtub before turning on the
                                    water. Adjust the temperature as the tub fills.<br> #7 Upgrade older
                                    toilets with water-saving WaterSense® labeled models.<br> #8 If your
                                    toilet flapper doesn’t close properly after flushing, replace it.<br>#9
                                    Use a WaterSense® labeled showerhead. They’re inexpensive, easy to
                                    install, and can save you up to 750 gallons a month.<br> #10 Turn
                                    off the water while you brush your teeth and save up to 4 gallons
                                    a minute. That’s up to 200 gallons a week for a family of four.<br>#11
                                    If your toilet was installed before 1992, purchasing a WaterSense®
                                    labeled toilet can reduce the amount of water used for each flush.
                                    <br> #12 Consider buying a dual-flush toilet. It has two flush options:
                                    a half-flush for liquid waste and a full-flush for solid waste.<br>#13
                                    Plug the sink instead of running the water to rinse your razor and
                                    save up to 300 gallons a month.<br> #14 Turn off the water while
                                    washing your hair and save up to 150 gallons a month.<br> #15 When
                                    washing your hands, turn the water off while you lather.<br> #16
                                    Take 5-minute showers instead of baths. A full bathtub requires up
                                    to 70 gallons of water.<br> #17 Install water-saving aerators on
                                    all of your faucets.<br> #18 Drop tissues in the trash instead of
                                    flushing them and save water every time.<br> #19 Look for WaterSense®
                                    labeled toilets, sink faucets, urinals and showerheads.<br> #20 One
                                    drip every second adds up to five gallons per day! Check your faucets
                                    and showerheads for leaks.<br> #21 While you wait for hot water,
                                    collect the running water and use it to water plants.</p>

                                <p>#1 Hire a qualified pro to install your irrigation system and keep it
                                    working properly and efficiently.<br> #2 Hire a Smartscape Certified
                                    professional landscaper who has received landscape training specific
                                    to the Sonoran Desert.<br> #3 Adjust your lawn mower to the height
                                    of 1.5 to 2 inches. Taller grass shades roots and holds soil moisture
                                    better than short grass.<br> #4 Leave lawn clippings on your grass,
                                    this cools the ground and holds in moisture.<br> #5 If installing
                                    a lawn, select a lawn mix or blend that matches your climate and
                                    site conditions.<br> #6 Aerate your lawn periodically. Holes every
                                    six inches will allow water to reach the roots, rather than run off
                                    the surface.<br> #7 If walking across the lawn leaves footprints
                                    (blades don’t spring back up), then it is time to water.<br> #8 Let
                                    your lawn go dormant (brown) during the winter. Dormant grass only
                                    needs to be watered every three to four weeks, less if it rains.<br>#9
                                    Avoid overseeding your lawn with winter grass. Ryegrass needs water
                                    every few days, whereas Dormant Bermuda grass needs water monthly.
                                    <br> #10 Remember to weed your lawn and garden regularly. Weeds compete
                                    with other plants for nutrients, light and water.<br> #11 While fertilizers
                                    promote plant growth, they also increase water consumption. Apply
                                    the minimum amount of fertilizer needed.<br> #12 Water your summer
                                    lawns once every three days and your winter lawn once every five
                                    days.
                                    <br> #13 Catch water in an empty tuna can to measure sprinkler output.
                                    3/4 to 1 inch of water is enough to apply each time you irrigate.
                                    <br> #14 Use a pool cover to help keep your pool clean, reduce chemical
                                    use and prevent water loss through evaporation.<br> #15 Make sure
                                    your swimming pools, fountains and ponds are equipped with recirculating
                                    pumps.
                                    <br> #16 If you have an automatic refilling device, check your pool
                                    periodically for leaks.<br> #17 When back-washing your pool, consider
                                    using the water on salt-tolerant plants in the landscape.<br> #18
                                    Minimize or eliminate the use of waterfalls and sprays in your pool.
                                    Aeration increases evaporation.
                                    <br> #19 Don’t overfill the pool. Lower water levels will reduce
                                    water loss due to splashing.<br> #20 Keep water in the pool when
                                    playing, it will save water.<br> #21 Instead of building a private
                                    pool, join a community pool.
                                    <br> #22 Trickling or cascading fountains lose less water to evaporation
                                    than those that spray water into the air.<br> #23 Use a grease pencil
                                    to conduct a bucket test to check for pool leaks. An unnatural water
                                    level drop may indicate a leak.<br><br><br><br></p>
